Until today I never took advantage of using multiple tmux sessions.  It's
really convenient to be able to switch between multiple projects without losing your
place. This requires no extra set-up aside from having tmux installed.

- Start a new session using your preferred method.
- Detach session with *prefix-d*
- View open sessions with *prefix-s*
- Tab through sessions with *prefix-(* & *prefix-)*

I found this to be a handy tool for blogging.  Since I now write my posts in
vim, I can have a session with a current draft and jekyll server running at all
times.  This way whenever I feel like adding a bit more I'm just a few key
presses away.

I'd be remiss if I didn't mention
[tmuxinator](https://github.com/tmuxinator/tmuxinator).  Wish setting up a tmux
environment was easy as pie?  It is... with tmuxinator.  Check it out.
