Hi. Thanks for visiting! I'm recent graduate of the University of Illinois, Chicago's Computer Science program. My primary interest is web application development. I'm particularly fond of open source and my tools of choice are vim, elixir, ruby, and javascript. I've spent the last decade working in the food industry and the last three years of that as a cheesemonger. Before that I served in many roles including Baker, Kitchen Manager, and Line Cook. I have a deep admiration for quality in food, and I seek to impart the same quality in my work as a software developer. When I'm not programming you can find me discovering new beers, eating at the best restaurants I can afford, and seeing live music.

I'm currently seeking an internship, apprenticeship, or other entry level position! If you're an Elixir, Ruby, and/or JS shop chances are I would love to be a part of your team!
