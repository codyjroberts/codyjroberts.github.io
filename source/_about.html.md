I'm a senior Computer Science student at the University of Illinois, Chicago. My primary interest is web application development. I'm particularly fond of the *convention over configuration* paradigm and focus on open source frameworks such as **Rails, Phoenix, and Ember**. Before returning to school I spent nearly a decade working in the food industry. Most recently I was a cheesemonger for Pastoral and before that served in many roles including Baker, Kitchen Manager, and Line Cook. I have a deep admiration for quality in food, and I seek to impart the same quality in my work as a developer.  When I'm not programming you can find me discovering new beers, eating at the best restaurants I can afford, and seeing live music.

I'm currently seeking an internship, apprenticeship, or other entry level position!  If you're a Phoenix/Rails/Ember consultancy firm or building next generation web services for the artisanal food and beverage industries, chances are I would love to be a part of your team!
