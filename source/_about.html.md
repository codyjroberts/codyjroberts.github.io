Hi. Thanks for visiting!  I'm a senior Computer Science student at the University of Illinois, Chicago. My primary interest is web application development. I'm particularly fond of the *convention over configuration* paradigm and focus on open source frameworks such as **Rails, Phoenix, and Ember**.  I've spent the last decade working in the food industry. Currently I work in specialty foods primarily as a cheesemonger. Before that I served in many roles including Baker, Kitchen Manager, and Line Cook. I have a deep admiration for quality in food, and I seek to impart the same quality in my work as a software developer.  I hope to help shape the next generation of the web as a consultant and OSS contributor.  When I'm not programming you can find me discovering new beers, eating at the best restaurants I can afford, and seeing live music.

I'm currently seeking an internship, apprenticeship, or other entry level position!  If you're a Phoenix, Rails, or Ember consultancy or building next generation web services with Elixir, chances are I would love to be a part of your team!
