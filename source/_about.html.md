I'm a senior CS student at UIC. My primary interest is web application development. I'm particularly fond of the *convention over configuration* motto and focus on open source frameworks such as **Rails, Phoenix, and Emberjs**. Before returning to school I spent nearly a decade working in the food industry. Most recently I was a cheesemonger for Pastoral and before that served in many roles including Baker, Kitchen Manager, and Line Cook. In my free time you can find me seeking out a new favorite beer and seeing live music.
