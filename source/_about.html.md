Hi. Thanks for visiting! I'm a senior Computer Science student at the University of Illinois, Chicago. My primary interest is web application development. I'm particularly fond of the convention over configuration paradigm and focus on open source frameworks such as Rails, Phoenix, and Ember. I've spent the last decade working in the food industry and the last three years of that as a cheesemonger. Before that I served in many roles including Baker, Kitchen Manager, and Line Cook. I have a deep admiration for quality in food, and I seek to impart the same quality in my work as a software developer. I hope to help shape the next generation of the web as a consultant and OSS contributor. When I'm not programming you can find me discovering new beers, eating at the best restaurants I can afford, and seeing live music.

I'm currently seeking an internship, apprenticeship, or other entry level position! If you're a Phoenix/Rails/Ember/Elm consultancy and/or building progressive web applications, chances are I would love to be a part of your team!
